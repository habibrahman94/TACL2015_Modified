## A script to run arithCplex executable on every math problem ILP input file in the
## specified folder. The output for each math problem is saved in a text file with
## the same name as the input file extended with a suffix. The script by default
## expects to find ../arithCplex and ../weights.conf, and launches CPLEX in
## multi-threaded mode.
